<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Bitcoin and a multitude of other cryptocurrencies are becoming popular and more valuable in recent years.  Its important to understand them and their place in the market.
</p>

<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>Exploring how Bitcoin correlates with both other cryptocurrencies and other physical currencies/stocks is important for investors and general consumer interest.  By exploring how related Bitcoin is we can determine its quality as an independent investment or if it will rise and fall with other financial investments.
</p>

<h1>Literature Survey</h1>
<p>When analyzing Dr Garrick Hileman & Michel Rauch’s “GLOBAL CRYPTOCURRENCY
BENCHMARKING STUDY”, from the University of Cambridge, we can get a better picture of the global cryptocurrency trend we see today. Dr Garrick Hileman & Michel Rauch’s provide an overall analysis of the rapidly growing sector of the world’s economy. We can use their input for acknowledging specific correlations that appeal interest for all investors.
</p>
<p>Also, in Sarah Pan’s article, “Analyzing Ethereum, Bitcoin, and 1200+ other Cryptocurrencies using PostgreSQL,” from Princeton University, we get a solid comprehension of the large amount of cryptocurrencies and how they impact an evolving market. She mentions her open source project known as “TimescaleDB” where she already has historical data regarding the value of many cryptocurrencies.  In fact, we may decide to use this open source project in order to make the analyzing easier. Furthermore, the database is built from PostgreSQL, which is the database library we intend to use for our data storage. Pan reflects about how this last decade has adapted a digital market of cryptocurrencies that have exponentially grown in value.</p>
<p>In Alexander D’Alfonso’s, Peter Langer’s, and Zintis Vandelis’s “Future of Cryptocurrency,” from Ryerson University, they mostly dig into the relationship between Bitcoin and Ethereum. The two cryptocurrencies that have noticeably increasing value. Although Ethereum and Bitcoin differ in value significantly, we can observe some crucial patterns that appear.  The data could show a correlation where one’s value goes down the other goes up.</p>

<h1>Milestones</h1>
<p>To achieve our milestones, we plan to use the agile project management methodology. This fits us because we know the end goal of our project, but don’t exactly know the means to how we will achieve this goal. We plan to do sprint cycles for all the milestones we want to achieve. Our milestones are as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Get all the raw data downloaded and backed up</li>
  <li>Preprocess data and store in our database</li>
  <li>Generate visualizations and math values to indicate similarities or correlations</li>
  <li>Determine the relationships between CC’s and other forms of investment.</li>
  <li>Predict what CC’s will perform well in the future</li>
</ol>
